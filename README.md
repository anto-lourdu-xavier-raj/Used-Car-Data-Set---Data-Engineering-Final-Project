# The used car dataset data engineering final project revolves around collecting, cleaning, and structuring data from various sources containing information on used cars. The process involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, and integrating data into a coherent structure. Stored in an optimized database, the data is subjected to exploratory analysis to derive insights and trends, visualized through graphs and charts. The project culminates in a deployable pipeline for automated updates and reports, utilizing tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL databases, and visualization libraries. Scalability, security, and processing efficiency are focal points throughout the project, ensuring a robust and actionable dataset for stakeholders.
